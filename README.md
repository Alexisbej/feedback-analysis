## Architecture

The application follows a hexagonal architecture (also known as ports and adapters) pattern:

- **Application Layer**: Use cases that orchestrate domain operations
- **Infrastructure**: External adapters for persistence, messaging, etc.

This approach allows for:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier testing through dependency isolation
- Flexibility to swap out infrastructure components
